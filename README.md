# Selective-MR-Imaging-Joint-Optimization-Design-with-RF-and-Shim-Fields
This repo contains the official code for the MRM papers ["Stochastic‐offset‐enhanced restricted slice excitation and 180° refocusing designs with spatially non‐linear ΔB0 shim array fields"]((https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.29827)) and ["Selective RF excitation designs enabled by time‐varying spatially non‐linear ΔB0 fields with applications in fetal MRI"]((https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.29114)).

This code is cleaned up from the previous repo ["Stochastic-offset-enhanced-restricted-slice-excitation-and-refocusing-designs"](https://github.com/molinzhang/Stochastic-offset-enhanced-restricted-slice-excitation-and-refocusing-designs).
