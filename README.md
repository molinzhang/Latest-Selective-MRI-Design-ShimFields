# Selective-MR-Imaging-Joint-Optimization-Design-with-RF-and-Shim-Fields
This is an updated repo for the MRM papers "Stochastic‐offset‐enhanced restricted slice excitation and 180° refocusing designs with spatially non‐linear ΔB0 shim array fields" and "Selective RF excitation designs enabled by time‐varying spatially non‐linear ΔB0 fields with applications in fetal MRI"
